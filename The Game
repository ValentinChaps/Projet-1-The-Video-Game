# Projet-1-The-Video-Game

This project was for the birthday of a friend who love to code and play video games, so we decide to make one for him, where he is the hero. 

"Projet-1" was code with renpy and some python too for the mini games. 

I did a lot of the writing but we only had 1 week and a half to code the game so a friend helped me by coding the introduction, the chapter 4 and the little rooms between the chapters and I did the rest. 

For the editing part I had another friend to do it and we all did a little bit of photoshop. You can play for 1 hour but I advise you to save for the final boss, he can be hard on you !

If you want to play the game you can download it with this link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oaH1N-SiEx58_2fqXNDeJbAlUSgtEAWb/view?usp=sharing
