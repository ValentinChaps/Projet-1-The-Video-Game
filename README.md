# Projet-1-The-Video-Game

This project was made for the birthday of a friend who love to code and play video games, so we decide to make one for him, where he's the hero. 

"Projet-1" was code with Renpy and some Python too for the mini games. 

I did a lot of the writing but we only had 1 week and a half to code it so a friend helped me by coding the introduction, the chapter 4 and the little rooms between the chapters. I code the rest. 

For the editing part I had another friend to do it and we all did a little bit of photoshop. You can play the game for 1 hour but I advise you to save for the final boss, he can be hard on you !
